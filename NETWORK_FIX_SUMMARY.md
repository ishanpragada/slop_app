# Network Issue Fix Summary

## Problem
The frontend was getting "Network request failed" errors when trying to connect to the backend API. The error occurred because:

- **Backend was running on**: `localhost:8000` (127.0.0.1:8000)
- **Frontend was trying to connect to**: `192.168.68.100:8000`
- **Result**: Network requests failed because localhost is only accessible from the same machine

## Root Cause
When starting the FastAPI backend with `uvicorn app.main:app --reload`, it defaults to binding only to `localhost` (127.0.0.1). This means:
- ✅ Accessible from the same machine (localhost:8000)
- ❌ NOT accessible from other devices on the network (192.168.68.100:8000)

## Solution
Start the backend with `--host 0.0.0.0` to bind to all network interfaces:

```bash
# ❌ Wrong - only accessible from same machine
uvicorn app.main:app --reload

# ✅ Correct - accessible from network
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Backend Server Configuration
- Stopped the old backend process that was only listening on localhost
- Started new backend process with `--host 0.0.0.0` to bind to all interfaces
- Verified the server is now accessible from the network

### 2. Created Startup Script
- Added `backend/start_server.sh` script that automatically uses the correct host binding
- Made the script executable with `chmod +x`

### 3. Enhanced Frontend Error Handling
- Added `testApiConnection()` function to test API connectivity
- Improved error messages with specific troubleshooting steps
- Added connection testing when components mount

### 4. Documentation
- Created `backend/README.md` with proper startup instructions
- Documented why `--host 0.0.0.0` is necessary
- Added troubleshooting section

## How to Start Backend (Going Forward)

### Option 1: Use the startup script (Recommended)
```bash
cd backend
./start_server.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual startup
```bash
cd backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

## Verification
The fix can be verified by:

1. **Backend health check**: `curl http://192.168.68.100:8000/health`
2. **API endpoint test**: `curl "http://192.168.68.100:8000/api/v1/feed/infinite?user_id=test_user&cursor=0&limit=10&refresh=true"`
3. **Frontend app**: Should now successfully load videos without network errors

## Why This Happens
- **Development vs Production**: In development, you often need network access for mobile testing
- **Network Binding**: `localhost` vs `0.0.0.0` determines which network interfaces the server binds to
- **Mobile Development**: Your phone needs to connect to your computer's network IP, not localhost

## Prevention
- Always use the startup script or remember `--host 0.0.0.0`
- The startup script will automatically use the correct configuration
- Check the README.md if you forget the correct startup command
