# 🚫 TEMPORARY VIDEO GENERATION DISABLE

This document outlines the temporary changes made to disable video generation for testing purposes.

## 📋 Summary of Changes

The following modifications have been made to **temporarily disable video generation** and **force the system to pick the 3 closest existing videos** regardless of similarity distance:

### 1. VideoGenerationQueueService (`backend/app/services/video_generation_queue_service.py`)

**Changes:**
- Modified `process_new_preference_vector()` to always force existing video processing
- Added new method `_process_existing_similar_prompts_force_three()` that:
  - Ignores similarity thresholds
  - Always picks the top 3 closest existing videos
  - Logs each selected video with ID, score, and prompt
- Updated `_find_similar_prompt_embeddings()` to return more candidates (100 instead of 50)

**Console Logging Added:**
```
🚫 TEMPORARY MODE: Video generation disabled for testing
🎯 FORCED SELECTION: Using top 3 closest existing videos
✅ SELECTED VIDEO 1: ID=xyz, Score=0.85, Prompt='A cat playing piano'
✅ SELECTED VIDEO 2: ID=abc, Score=0.82, Prompt='Dog dancing in rain'
✅ SELECTED VIDEO 3: ID=def, Score=0.78, Prompt='Sunset over mountains'
📊 FINAL SELECTION: 3 videos will be added to queue

📝 PROMPTS BEING ADDED TO QUEUE:
   1. Video ID: xyz
      Prompt: 'A cat playing piano'
      Similarity Score: 0.850
      S3 URL: https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/xyz.mp4

   2. Video ID: abc
      Prompt: 'Dog dancing in rain'
      Similarity Score: 0.820
      S3 URL: https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/abc.mp4

   3. Video ID: def
      Prompt: 'Sunset over mountains'
      Similarity Score: 0.780
      S3 URL: https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/def.mp4

✅ Added video xyz to queue with score 0.850
   📝 Prompt: 'A cat playing piano'
   🔗 S3 URL: https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/xyz.mp4

✅ Added video abc to queue with score 0.820
   📝 Prompt: 'Dog dancing in rain'
   🔗 S3 URL: https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/abc.mp4

✅ Added video def to queue with score 0.780
   📝 Prompt: 'Sunset over mountains'
   🔗 S3 URL: https://s3.amazonaws.com/bucket/def.mp4

✅ Added video xyz to user feed (score: 85.00)
   📝 Feed Video Prompt: 'A cat playing piano'
✅ Added video abc to user feed (score: 82.00)
   📝 Feed Video Prompt: 'Dog dancing in rain'
✅ Added video def to user feed (score: 78.00)
   📝 Feed Video Prompt: 'Sunset over mountains'

📺 Added 3/3 videos to User Feed Queue for user123
```

### 2. BackgroundVideoWorker (`backend/app/services/background_video_worker.py`)

**Changes:**
- Modified `_generate_video_for_task()` to skip actual video generation
- Returns `True` immediately to mark task as "completed" without generating

**Console Logging Added:**
```
🚫 TEMPORARY MODE: Video generation disabled for testing
   Would have generated video for user user123
   Would have used prompt: A cat playing piano
   Skipping actual video generation and marking task as completed
```

### 3. API Endpoints (`backend/app/routers/api.py`)

**Changes:**
- Modified `/ai/videos/generate` endpoint to return HTTP 503 error
- Prevents direct API calls from generating videos

**Error Response:**
```
HTTP 503: Video generation temporarily disabled for testing. Please try again later.
```

## 🔧 How to Test

1. **Trigger preference processing** by having a user interact with videos (likes, views, etc.)
2. **Watch the console logs** to see which videos are selected
3. **Check the app** to confirm the selected videos appear in the feed

## 🔄 How to Revert Changes

When you're ready to re-enable video generation, make these changes:

### 1. VideoGenerationQueueService
```python
# In process_new_preference_vector(), change:
return self._process_existing_similar_prompts_force_three(user_id, similar_prompts)

# Back to:
if above_threshold_count >= self.min_similar_prompts:
    print(f"✅ Found {above_threshold_count} similar prompts above threshold (>= {self.min_similar_prompts})")
    return self._process_existing_similar_prompts(user_id, similar_prompts)
else:
    print(f"⚠️  Only found {above_threshold_count} prompts above threshold (< {self.min_similar_prompts})")
    print(f"🎯 Using top 1 k-nearest neighbor for LLM prompt generation")
    return self._generate_new_similar_prompts(user_id, similar_prompts, preference_vector)
```

### 2. BackgroundVideoWorker
```python
# In _generate_video_for_task(), remove the early return and restore the original video generation code
```

### 3. API Endpoints
```python
# In generate_ai_video_complete(), remove the HTTP 503 error and restore the original generation code
```

## 📝 Files Modified

- `backend/app/services/video_generation_queue_service.py` - Main logic + feed priority fix
- `backend/app/services/background_video_worker.py` - Disabled video generation  
- `backend/app/services/redis_service.py` - Fixed add_to_feed logic
- `backend/app/routers/api.py` - Disabled API endpoint
- `TEMPORARY_VIDEO_GENERATION_DISABLE.md` (this file)

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- These changes are **TEMPORARY** and should be reverted after testing
- The system will now **always pick the 3 closest videos** regardless of similarity
- **No new videos will be generated** during this testing period
- All video generation attempts will be **logged but skipped**
- Videos should appear in the app immediately (no restart required)

## 🐛 Root Cause Found and Fixed!

**ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: The original problem was in `RedisService.add_to_feed()`. The method was returning `False` when videos already existed in the feed, even though updating their scores was successful.

**ROOT CAUSE**: 
```python
result = client.zadd(feed_key, {video_id: score})
return result > 0  # This fails when video exists (zadd returns 0 for updates)
```

**FIX APPLIED**: Modified `RedisService.add_to_feed()` to return `True` for both new additions and score updates, since both are successful operations.

### 4. RedisService Fix (`backend/app/services/redis_service.py`)

**Changes:**
- Fixed `add_to_feed()` logic to treat score updates as successful
- Added detailed Redis operation logging
- Now returns `True` for both new videos and existing video score updates

**Console Logging Added:**
```
🔍 Redis ZADD result for video123: 0 (0=updated existing, >0=new element)
✅ Added video video123 to user feed (score: 85.00)
   📝 Feed Video Prompt: 'A cat playing piano'
```

## 🔧 Testing Results

With the fix applied, videos should now:
1. ✅ Be selected from existing videos (forced top 3)
2. ✅ Be added to Redis queue successfully  
3. ✅ **Be added to user feed successfully** (previously failing)
4. ✅ **Appear at the TOP of the feed immediately** (high priority scores)
5. ✅ Be visible without restart or scrolling through long feeds

### 5. Feed Priority Enhancement

**Additional Fix Applied**: New videos are now added with high timestamp-based scores to ensure they appear at the **front** of the feed immediately.

**Changes:**
- Use `timestamp * 1000 + similarity_score` for feed scores
- Clear older videos from long feeds to make room
- New videos appear first instead of being buried in long feeds

**Console Logging Added:**
```
📊 Current feed size: 156
🧹 TEMPORARY: Removing 39 older videos to make room for new ones
✅ Removed 39 older videos from feed
📊 Feed size after cleanup: 117
🚀 HIGH PRIORITY FEED SCORE: 1726345678234.27 (timestamp: 1726345678234.00 + similarity: 30.27)
✅ Added video xyz to user feed (score: 1726345678234.27)
```

## 🐛 Original Debugging Process

Key areas investigated:
1. ✅ **Redis Feed Addition**: Found and fixed the core issue
2. **Feed Service**: Verified `InfiniteFeedService` pulls from Redis correctly  
3. **Frontend Refresh**: App polling works when feed is populated
4. **Queue Processing**: Videos were being queued but not fed correctly

The enhanced logging helped identify that videos were failing to be added to the user feed queue.
